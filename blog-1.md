***Union Type:

// A union type is a type that allows a value to be one of several specified types, created by listing each type with the `|` (pipe) symbol between them. Union types are helpful when a variable or parameter could logically be more than one type, such as a string or a number, and they enable flexibility by permitting multiple possible types for a single value.

// Example of Union Type

// type NumberOrString = number | string;

// let value: NumberOrString;
// value = 42;            // valid, as 42 is a number
// value = "Hello";       // valid, as "Hello" is a string
// value = true;          // Error: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'NumberOrString'

// Significance of Intersection Types

// Here's a simplified, bullet-point version of the significance of union types in TypeScript:

// - **Flexibility**: Union types allow variables or function parameters to accept multiple types when data can come in different forms.
  
// - **Error Reduction**: TypeScript ensures only common methods and properties of all union types are accessible. This prevents errors from trying to access incompatible properties.

// - **Type Narrowing**: TypeScript helps to determine the specific type of a union value using `typeof` checks or custom logic. This allows to handle each type correctly. 

// - **Improved Code Reliability**: Union types ensure addressing all possible types, making your code more robust and error-free.


// Intersection Type:

// An **intersection type** in TypeScript combines multiple types into a single type, meaning a value must satisfy all the types included. It is created using the `&` (ampersand) symbol. This allows you to create a new type that has all properties and methods of the intersected types, making it useful for combining traits or characteristics from multiple types into one.
